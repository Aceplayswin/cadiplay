// Theme 1 manifest — "Dollara" (dark glass).
//
// Everything this theme is lives under this folder: its shell (chrome), its
// pages, and any theme-scoped CSS. The registry auto-discovers themes by looking
// for `themes/<key>/index.js`, so a build that ships ONLY this folder works with
// no edits anywhere else — delete the sibling theme folders and the app still
// builds and runs. See ../registry.js and scripts/extract-theme.mjs.
