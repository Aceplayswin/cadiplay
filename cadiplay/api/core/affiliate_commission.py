"""The commission engine.

Runs once a day (or on demand from the admin console) and turns yesterday's
player activity into ledger entries. Three kinds of money come out of it:

* **revenue share** — a percentage of the net gaming revenue the affiliate's
  referred players generated (company profit when players lose);
* **CPA** — a one-off bounty when a referred player makes a qualifying first
  deposit;
* **override** — the parent (level 2) cut of a sub-affiliate's earnings. It is
  taken out of the level-1 amount, not paid on top:
  - rev-share: player loss ₹100 at 30% → ₹30; 5% override → parent ₹1.50 / child ₹28.50
  - CPA: first deposit only, fixed bounty ₹100; 5% override → parent ₹5 / child ₹95

Two decisions here matter more than the rest:

**NGR comes from ``game_rounds``, not ``bets``.** The ``bets`` table has a single
writer, the legacy ``services.place_bet``, and the live aggregator flow never
touches it. An engine reading ``bets`` computes zero forever while appearing to
work perfectly, which is the worst possible failure mode for money.

**Idempotency is enforced by the database.** Every entry carries a computed
``dedupe_key`` under a unique constraint. Re-running a period updates entries
that are still pending and refuses to touch anything already approved or paid,
so a re-run after fixing a rate corrects the future without rewriting history.
