"""Gaming-module business logic: launch, sessions, callback settlement, reporting.

This is the clean-architecture core of the gaming module. It orchestrates:

- **Launch**: validate the user/wallet/game, ask the aggregator for a launch URL
  (via the provider service layer), and open/refresh a :class:`GameSession`.
- **Callback settlement**: decrypt + validate an aggregator bet/win callback and
  apply it to the wallet *idempotently* and *transaction-safely* (row lock +
  unique ``serial_number``), updating session + wallet + transaction ledger.
- **Reporting**: per-user play history and P&L.

All wire-protocol / crypto concerns live in ``services/game_provider.py``; all
data access lives in ``core/repositories.py``. This module never talks HTTP or
SQL directly beyond the repositories and the ORM transaction helpers.
